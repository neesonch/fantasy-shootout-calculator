Simple React app for predicting the likely game script* for each game of the upcoming 2018 season for each NFL team. This is done by comparing each offensive and defensive rankings for each team (rankings must be input by the user). 


* i.e. Whether the team is winning or losing: a losing team is likely to pass more, increasing stats volume in the passing game. Conversely teams that are winning tend to run more, inreasing stats volume for the run game.
